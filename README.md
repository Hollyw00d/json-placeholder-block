# JSON Placeholder Block

## Description
A simple WordPress (WP) plugin that pulls in post data from JSONPlaceholder (jsonplaceholder.org) in a JSON format and adds a block where you can view this content on the front-end and back-end using React.

## Why?
This plugin was created so I (Matt Jennings - [see portfolio](https://www.mattjennings.net/)) could a WP plugin that:
- Has a settings page where I could add in a URL to show posts on jsonplaceholder.org (like [https://jsonplaceholder.org/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.org/posts) or [https://jsonplaceholder.org/posts/66](https://jsonplaceholder.org/posts/66)) in a JSON format which is saved to the WP database

- Create a [block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/) that:
  - Pulls in the JSON data using the [WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/tutorial/using-the-wordpress-rest-api/) using React in the WP Admin for a post or page AND the front-end

- This code was adapted by Matt Jennings ([GitHub Profile](https://github.com/Hollyw00d)) from the [https://github.com/jareckicode/react-on-frontend-block/](https://github.com/jareckicode/react-on-frontend-block/) GitHub repo created by Michał Jarecki.
