# Disable Plugin by Environment WordPress Plugin

This WordPress plugin disables (or deactives) plugins by environment. For example, if you have a user tracking plugin that you want enabled only on the PROD environment website then it can be disabled in other environment websites (STAGING, DEV, LOCAL, etc.).

__This plugin has only been tested on a local website, is a work in progress, and is for WordPress experts only, so use with caution!__
